          <h1>Project Overview</h1>
          <p>Alvo is a FPS (First Person Shooter) VR game in Battle Royale mode - a group of players fight to the end,
            last survivor wins.</p>
          <p class="objective">The goal was to push the edge of what's possible in VR, and make Alvo stand out among the
            sea of competition.</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          In fall of 2019, I was approached by the CEO of Mardonpol Inc. - a 2x client of mine - to design interface for
          a VR game.
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
          In this case study, I'll walk you through how I morphed exisiting design principles to suit a medium I had
          never designed for before.
        </p>
      </section>

      <div class="content-divider"></div>
      <section class="content-width">
        <h3>Reality Check</h3>
        <p>The first step was to research what users are already familiar with and expect a VR game to be. <span
            class="make-italic">(Jacob's Law)</span></p>
        <p>Unsurprisingly, VR Field of View (FOV) <span class="make-bold">mimicks real life</span> - player focus
          remains at the center of the FOV
          thus allowing anything to be placed within that area.</p>
        <div class="content-image">
          <img loading="lazy" src="../Works/Images/Alvo/Degree.png" alt="">
          <span class="caption">Real vs. reality</caption>
        </div>
        <p class="make-bold">It comes with a catch, though - place elements too near and it will cause nausea, place
          them too far and it'd be <span class="make-italic">difficult to see.</span></p>
        <p>To take full advantage of the wider field of view in VR, it was important to have an idea where on the plane
          it was easiest for the player to interact.</p>
        <div class="content-image">
          <img loading="lazy" src="../Works/Images/Alvo/Comfortable Area.png" alt="">
          <span class="caption">Prompts to encourage exploration</caption>
        </div>
        <p>I explored the idea of <span class="make-bold">prompting users to turn their heads</span> by placing signs
          and overlapping elements in the Field of View.</p>
        <div class="content-image">
          <img loading="lazy" src="../Works/Images/Alvo/Outline.png" alt="">
          <span class="caption">An outline view of how I viewed the gamer</caption>
        </div>
        <p>There was also the question of simulating VR in <span class="make-bold">Figma, a 2D software</span>. I
          decided to create <span class="make-bold">virtual scenes out of multiple images</span>, and used a 1440x900
          window as a viewport for
          the gamer.</p>
        <p>It turned out to be a good find, as seen in the next section.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="content-width">
        <h3>Head turner</h3>

        <p class="make-bold">Hover or Tap over this image to see more.</p>

          </div>
          <span class="caption">Indicators for additonal information</caption>
        </div>

        <h4>Turning heads, literally.</h4>
        <p>Putting my theories to the test, events outside the FOV <span class="make-bold">triggered a marker</span>
          that drew
          attention.</p>
        <p>I took care, though, to put everything important within the gamer's HUD, creating a surreal experience not
          often seen in traditional gameplay.</p>

        <div class="content-image">
          <img loading="lazy" src="../Works/Images/Alvo/POV Elements.png" alt="">
          <span class="caption">The in-game HUD</caption>
        </div>

        <h4>Virtual POV</h4>
        <p>Even though this is a new medium, <span class="make-bold">gamers shouldn't have to learn a new way of
            navigating
            it.</span></p>
        <p>Taking a cue from existing games and traditional UX, I created an interface that was familiar for gamers and
          adapted to VR effortlessly.</p>

        <ul class="lightslider">
          <li class="slide-item" data-thumb="../Works/Images/Alvo/Select Game Mode.png">

            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Spoilt for choice.</h4>

        <p>Just like a traditional Battle Royale, loadouts have been added that <span class="make-bold">can be
            customised with different items</span> and can be accessed in-game.</p>
        <p>These are traditional menus that would appear hovering in <span class="make-italic">"mid-air"</span> and can
          be accessed using the VR controller.</p>

        <div class="content-image">
          <div class="is-scrolling-vr both-scroll"
            style="background-image: url('../Works/Images/Alvo/Finish\ Screen.png');">

          </div>
          <span class="caption">A simulation of turning left and right</caption>
        </div>

        <h4>Victory</h4>
        <p>Using the <span class="make-bold">same pattern of turning heads</span>, gamers will be able to start a new
          game from the vitory screen itself.</p>
        <p>Alvo has modes of gameplay with different maps, and an user would be able to see the details in a helpful
          tile.</p>

      </section>

      <section class="content-width">
        <h3>Level up your game</h3>
        <p>Gamers won't be gamers if they didn't want to see their progress.</p>
        <p>Alvo wouldn't be Alvo if they didn't reward them for it.</p>
        <p>Military icons were used to <span class="make-bold">create badges that were rewarded to players</span> in
          recognition for their skill levels
          in the game.</p>

        <h4>In-game purchases</h4>
        <p>Games are fun, and players love to showcase individuality while having fun. Alvo didn't want them to miss out
          on that.</p>
        <p>Several random pattern & color masks were created to give the players a choice in how <span
            class="make-bold">they look like to
            their teammates, and how they show up in leaderboards.</span></p>

        <h3>Caring for the gamer</h3>
        <p>VR headsets have been said to create a <span class="make-bold">feeling of nausea</span> in certain cases -
          care has been taken not to
          include any flashing graphics or distracting animations that might accelerate the feeling.</p>
        <p>Addtionally, rounds have been kept at <span class="make-bold">a max limit of 10 mins</span> and a <span
            class="make-bold">virtual warning</span> was included if the
          player is using the headset for a long time.

        <p>The design was a successful implementation of the primary objective: <span class="make-bold">make Alvo stand

        <p>Developers found it very easy work with the style guide. The assets were <span class="make-bold">custom made

          <li><span class="make-bold">Design fundamentals are universal.</span>
            <p>From VR to Web to apps, design fundamentals of UX never change and humans will never stop responding to
              good design.</p>
